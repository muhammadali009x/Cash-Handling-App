# monee

  Since everytime that someone does a TODO app somewhere in the world dies a puppy i've decided to make something different. Something that is propably nearly as popular - a personal finance manager x). Idea is simple - you enter data in one place and you view it as a chart/list in other.
  Why **Monee**? Simply because it's pronunciated exactly like money, but looks different.

* Simple money management app made with React.js (create-react-app)
* Routing made with react-router
* Firebase acts as an easy to set JSON database and an API

### TODO:
* RWD - I've decided to focus mostly on the 'logic' part of the app first. Currently it's definitely not mobile friendly however that's first thing to be done when i finish React part of the app.
* Tidy up CSS - at the beginning I thought that simply making separate css files for each component will be enough, well it seems that I was wrong. Definitely have to either use styled components or switch to SASS.
* To finish the app i have to:

    * tidy up css and make the app mobile friendly
    * generate some fake data
    * decide how to process data from API depending on type of chart selected (pie chart or line chart) or if list of all entries has been selected
    * add authentication and account management in the future (will use firebase for it as well)
